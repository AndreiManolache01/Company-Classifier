The project I developed is a company classifier that uses data from a CSV file to categorize companies based on their descriptions, tags, and niche. The file "ml_insurance_challenge.csv" contains a list of companies with their subcategories, while "insurance_taxonomy.xlsx" provides the list of possible labels. My code assigns one or more labels to each company depending on the subcategories found in the first file. To compare company texts, I converted both the company descriptions and the taxonomy labels into numerical vectors, allowing me to capture the relevance of words. Then, I measured the similarity between these vectors—where 1 means identical and 0 means completely different—and classified the companies that exceeded a similarity threshold of 0.2.
